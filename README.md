This is my first project after learning javascript

1.I learned many new topics while working on this project.
2.Initially, I struggled with the logic, but I managed to overcome it.
3.I faced some difficulties, but I didn’t give up—I resolved the issues and fixed the bugs.
4.I understood how arrays and functions work in real-time scenarios.
